# Shelly

This article is written for myself, just to keep something with respect to Shelly library.

##About Shelly

It has been a long time since I came up with the idea about this library. However, I had written
nothing until mid-May, 2016. At that time, I wanted to make this library similar to RxJava. But it
was so difficult, in that its usage is different from RxJava. So, although the core part is, as
RxJava, written in reactive and functional programming, the principle is quite different. I think
it is such a novel technique. It can be an invention. Really! If you look inside at the source code,
you will agree with me.

More will be mentioned in the future.

##About myself

Some friends say that I am a gifted man, which I admit, because since I was a pupil, I have been a
quite clever boy. And almost every teacher has appreciated my talent. But it is useless when it
comes to the work, because I do not know how to present what I have done, which is quite important.
The leader does not know what you have done, but he know what you say about what you have done. Thus
some people have almost done nothing but succeed in boasting his work and finally are appreciated by
leaders. They are not gifted in IQ, but gifted in EQ.

As for me, it seems that only when I have done something quite splendid can I be appreciated by
others.

Do you know why I named this project Shelly? What a fucking sad story it is!

Recently I have been devoted in my work! DEVOTED!!!

While others are dating, I am writing code!

While others are playing, I am writing code!

While others are mating, I am writing code!

What am I writing code for? Coding is my hobby!

What is more important? I need money.

Do not tell me working is not only for money! EVER!

##Difficulties

I thought of a lot of the ideas about how to write this library at Gate 7 of Century Park. At first
I want to make this project similar to RxJava, but I found that quite difficult, so I made it easier
and finished v0.1. Some time later, I came up with a wonderful idea about how to add mapping into
Domino class, so I continued to write code. Some days ago, I thought of an idea about how to add
more features such as flatMap, merge, etc into my project.

After I finish this project, I will write a project named RetrofitShelly to add Retrofit in.

##Sadness

I do not know whether I should promote this library in the name of the company. Most of my work on
this project is done on my own and has nothing to do with the company. I write code after work and
think of the idea out of company, even at weekends.

Nobody sees my work until it works.
