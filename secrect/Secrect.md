# Shelly

This article is written for myself, just to memorize something with respect to Shelly library.

## On the Shelly Shelly

It has been a long time since I came up with the idea about this library, with which I can, in a
single place rather than in many classes within the whole project, wrote the source code concerning
a particular piece of business logic. However, because I failed to figure out a wonderful pattern,
I had written nothing until mid-May, 2016. In May 2016, I began to learn how to use RxJava and
inspired by RxJava, I began to figure out something about the Shelly library.

At first, I wanted to make the Shelly library similar to RxJava. And I also wanted to learn from
the source code of RxJava and then wrote the source code of the Shelly library. But it was so
difficult to write the Shelly library, in that its usage is different from RxJava. So, although
the core part is, as RxJava is, written in reactive and functional programming, the principle is
quite different. It takes me a long time to figure out how to compose the Shelly library. I think
it is such a novel technique. It can be an invention really! If you look inside at the source code,
you will agree with me.

More will be mentioned in the future.

## On myself

Some friends say that I am a gifted man, because since I was a pupil, I have been a
quite clever boy. And almost every teacher has appreciated my talent.

Do you know why I named this project "Shelly"? What a sad story it is!

Recently I have been devoted in my work! DEVOTED!!!

While others are dating, I am writing code!

While others are playing, I am writing code!

While others are mating, I am writing code!

What am I writing code for? Coding is my hobby!

What is more important? I need money.

Do not tell me working is for not only money but something else! EVER!

## On difficulties

It was at Gate 7 of Century Park that I came up with many wonderful ideas about how to write
the Shelly library.

At first I want to make this project similar to RxJava, but I found it is quite difficult, so I
simplified the library and released v0.1. Some time later, I came up with a wonderful idea about
how to add the mapping method into the Domino class, so I continued to write code. Some days later,
I thought of an idea about how to add more features such as flatMap, merge and something else
into my project.

## On sadness

I do not know whether I should promote this library in the name of the company. Most of my work on
this project is done on my own and has nothing to do with the company. I wrote code after work and
came up with a lot of ideas out of the company, even at weekends.

Nobody sees my work until it works.
