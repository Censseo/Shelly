# Shelly

This article is written for myself, just to keep something with respect to Shelly library.

It has been a long time since I came up with the idea about this library. However, I had written
nothing until mid-May, 2016. At that time, I wanted to make this library similar to RxJava. But it
was so difficult, in that its usage is different from RxJava. So, although the core part is, as
RxJava, written in reactive and functional programming, the principle is quite different. I think
it is such a novel technique. It can be an invention. Really! If you look inside at the source code,
you will
agree with me.
